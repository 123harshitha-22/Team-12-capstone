major project -disease detection through x ray images
This project focuses on developing a hybrid deep learning model that integrates both X-ray and CT scan data for early disease detection, particularly targeting respiratory and lung diseases. By combining the complementary strengths of X-rays (quick and low-cost imaging) and CT scans (detailed 3D visualization), the model aims to improve diagnostic accuracy. It employs advanced 2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with cross-modal feature fusion techniques to extract, combine, and analyze critical features from both imaging modalities. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnoses.

The early detection of diseases is crucial for timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this project, we present a machine learning-based system for automatic disease detection from X-ray images. The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in medical imaging, particularly X-ray analysis, has shown significant promise in enhancing early disease detection. This presentation explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other ML methodologies to accurately identify various diseases from X-ray images. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, we aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. This work emphasizes the importance of feature extraction, data preprocessing, and model validation in creating robust ML models capable of assisting healthcare professionals in clinical settings!
